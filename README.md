    |-- holonomic_x_drive.v5python
    |-- holonomic_x_drive.v5cpp
    |-- holonomic_x_drive.v5blocks
- `holonomic_x_drive.v5python`: Python implementation of the code using VEX V5 Python API.
- `holonomic_x_drive.v5cpp`: C++ implementation of the code using VEX V5 C++ API.
- `holonomic_x_drive.v5blocks`: VEXcode Blocks project file for graphical programming.

## Getting Started
To use this codebase, follow these steps:

1. **Selecting the Right Implementation:**
   - Choose the appropriate file based on your preferred programming language: Python (`holonomic_x_drive.v5python`), C++ (`holonomic_x_drive.v5cpp`), or graphical programming using VEXcode Blocks (`holonomic_x_drive.v5blocks`).

2. **Downloading Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and libraries installed for your chosen programming language.

3. **Uploading to Robot Brain:**
   - Upload the selected code file to your VEX V5 Robot Brain using VEXcode or the VEX Coding Studio.

4. **Configuring Motors:**
   - Adjust motor ports and any other configuration settings within the code to match your robot's hardware setup.

5. **Calibrating Sensors (if applicable):**
   - If your robot uses sensors, ensure they are calibrated according to your specific requirements.

6. **Testing:**
   - Test the robot in a controlled environment to ensure that the Holonomic X-Drive functions as expected.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into modular components for ease of understanding and modification. Key sections include:
- **Initialization:** Setup of motor ports, sensor configurations, and any other necessary initializations.
- **Drive Control:** Implementation of the Holonomic X-Drive control logic.
- **Autonomous Functions (if applicable):** Pre-programmed functions for autonomous operation.
